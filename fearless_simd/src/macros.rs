//! Macros publicly exported

/// Access the applicable [`Simd`] for a given `level`, and perform an operation using it.
///
/// This macro is the root of how any explicitly written SIMD functions in this crate are
/// called from a non-SIMD context.
///
/// The first parameter to the macro is the [`Level`].
/// You should prefer to construct a [`Level`] once and pass it around, rather than
/// frequently calling [`Level::new()`].
/// This is because `Level::new` has to detect which target features are available, which can be slow.
///
/// The code of the operation will be repeated literally several times in the output, so you should prefer
/// to keep this code small (as it will be type-checked, etc. for each supported SIMD level on your target).
/// In most cases, it should be a single call to a function which is generic over `Simd` implementations,
/// as seen in [the examples](#examples).
/// For clarity, it will only be executed once per execution of `dispatch`.
///
/// To guarantee target-feature-specific code generation, any functions called within the operation should
/// be `#[inline(always)]`.
///
/// Note that as an implementation detail of this macro, the operation will be executed inside a closure.
/// This is what enables the target features to be enabled for the code inside the operation.
/// A consequence of this is that early `return` and `?` will not work as expected.
/// Note that in cases where you use `dispatch` to call a single function (which we expect to be the
/// majority of cases), you can use `?` on the return value of dispatch instead.
/// To emulate early return, you can use [`ControlFlow`](core::ops::ControlFlow) instead.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use fearless_simd::{Level, Simd, dispatch};
///
/// #[inline(always)]
/// fn sigmoid<S: Simd>(simd: S, x: &[f32], out: &mut [f32]) { /* ... */ }
///
/// let level = Level::new();
///
/// dispatch!(level, simd => sigmoid(simd, &[/*...*/], &mut [/*...*/]));
/// ```
///
/// [`Level`]: crate::Level
/// [`Level::new()`]: crate::Level::new
/// [`Simd`]: crate::Simd
